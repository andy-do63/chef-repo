=========

Assignment:
	Create a cookbook that installs Nginx running on CentOS 6.7. I will expect to see Nginx running and ready for initial setup when I converge your recipe. You may leverage community cookbooks for dependencies and ideas but all code should be your own. We will expect your cookbook to use server spec and test kitchen for acceptance testing. Our expectations will be to either git clone or unpack your delivered cookbook and execute the command chef exec rake in order to run the tests. Our environments will be running the latest version of chef-dk.

Progression:
	My first attempt was on a CentOS VM with only chef and ruby installed.
